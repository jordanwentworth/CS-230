1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room was a client that wanted their Android base app to be open and used on other operating systems. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I brought to the Gaming Room an indepth evaluation of each operating systems. I provided which operating systems are easy to use, cost efficent and what the pros/cons are to       each one. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    The UML diagram provided a visual look at what is going on in each part of the system. It made it easier to understand what was happening. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I think I could provide a better indepth look at the recommendations to the Gaming Room. I was very broad with my recommendations. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    When focusing on the user's needs, there are two things to look at. The first is appearence and how the app looks. User's want a friendly interface. The second thing is           functionality. The user wants an app to be easy to use and to always work without bugs.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    I listened to the client and started out small. As I kept working through, the design document kept me on track.
